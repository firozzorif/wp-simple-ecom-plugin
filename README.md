### **About**

**WP‑Ecom** is a **custom WordPress plugin** developed as part of my learning journey to understand **WordPress plugin architecture**, **PHP OOP**, and **basic e‑commerce workflows**.

It includes everything needed for a **basic store**: products, cart, checkout, and a simple orders view — all built from scratch without relying on WooCommerce or other frameworks.

---

### **Features**

* **Custom Product Post Type** – Manage products with custom fields.
* **12 Demo Products** – Preloaded on activation (so the store isn’t empty).
* **Cart & Checkout Pages** – Functional flow using shortcodes.
* **Orders Page** – Basic admin interface for viewing placed orders.
* **Clean & Lightweight** – No unnecessary dependencies.

---

### **Installation**

1. **Download or Clone** this repository.
2. Place the folder in:

   ```
   wp-content/plugins/wp-ecom/
   ```
3. Activate **WP‑Ecom** from the **Plugins** page in WordPress.
4. Create two pages:

   * **Cart** → Add `[wepf_cart]` shortcode.
   * **Checkout** → Add `[wepf_checkout]` shortcode.
5. Visit `/products` to see the demo store in action.
